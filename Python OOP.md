# Python OOP

### Problems with procedural programming:
* Data separated from functions
* Lack of modularity
* High coupling
* Re-use difficult
* Not modelling the real world

### Benefits of OOP:
* Data and functions combined
* Better modularity 
* Low coupling
* Re-use easier
* Closely modelling the real world

### Principles of OOP:
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

### Abstraction:
#### Unit of abstraction:
* Class - used to represent abstraction
* An object is an instance of a class
* A class is a type of object

### Encapsulation:
* Provide a simple consistent interface to use the object
* Hide data and implementation details inside
* Each class has a well detailed responsibility

### Inheritance:
* Choose to create different types
* Create a heirachy type structure to show the relationship
* Superclass and subclass also base class and derived class

### Polymorphism:
* Get a message and perform the action
